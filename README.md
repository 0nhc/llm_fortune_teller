# 🔮 LLM Fortune Teller (Multi-Agent Debate)

A multi-agent LLM debating system wrapped around BaZi (八字) / Four Pillars fortune reading. Inspired by evidence that debate can improve factuality and reasoning in language models (see: [Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zj7YuTE4t8)), I found the same “argue it out, then converge” loop works surprisingly well for fortune-teller style narratives too.

At its core is `close_loop.py`: a reusable debate-and-refine engine that can be adapted to other applications beyond a fortune teller.

Given a birth datetime and gender, the program computes structured BaZi signals (pillars, relations, DaYun, etc.), then uses the debate loop to produce a clearer, more consistent final report.

## ✨ Features
* ✅ Multi-LLM support (Gemini / OpenAI / DeepSeek) via API keys
* ✅ CLI-first workflow, easy to automate

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
python ./main.py \
  --name test \
  --year 1900 --month 1 --day 1 \
  --hour 12 --minute 00 \
  --gender male
```

## 📦 Installation

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`, `conda`, `mamba`, etc.). Recommended: **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0nhc/llm_fortune_teller.git
cd llm_fortune_teller
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔑 Configure LLM API Keys

Export keys in each new terminal, or add them to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="<your-gemini-api-key>"      # https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
export CHATGPT_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"     # https://platform.openai.com/
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="<your-deepseek-api-key>"  # https://api-docs.deepseek.com/
```
